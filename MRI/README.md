# Example scripts for  converting CBU MRI DICOM data to BIDS format

The scripts in the *code* directory are example scripts on how to convert raw DICOM data to [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) using [HeuDiConv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

The tutorial on how to use the scripts is available [here](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/dicom-bids|). The tutorial is CBU specific, but can be easily adapted to any other source of raw DICOM data and computing system.
