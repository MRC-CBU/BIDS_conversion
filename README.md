# The brain imaging data structure

[The Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (BIDS) is a standard for organising neuroimaging and behavioural data that enables easy **sharing**, **reuse**, and **application** of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols (such as [BIDS Apps](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/), or your/your group's own pipelines).

It is highly recommended to have your data organised in BIDS! We have created two tutorials on how to convert your raw data into BIDS: 

* [MRI to BIDS](MRI)

* [MEG/EEG to BIDS](MEG)
